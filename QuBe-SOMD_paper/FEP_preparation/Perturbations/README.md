Example perturbation files.

Here you will find the .mapping, .mergeat0.pdb, .pert, .prm7 and .rst7 files created in the last step of FEP_preparation [README.md] (https://github.com/cole-group/qube_project/blob/master/QuBe-SOMD_paper/FEP_preparation/README.md) for the unbound transition of Lig1-Lig2.
These files are required for free energy calculations.
